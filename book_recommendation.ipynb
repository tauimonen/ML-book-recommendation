    "## Book Recommendation Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Books Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Books are identified by their ISBN codes.  \n",
    "Additionally, content-based information is included, such as **Book-Title**, **Book-Author**, **Year-Of-Publication**, and **Publisher**, which have been retrieved from Amazon Web Services.  \n",
    "If a book has multiple authors, only the first author appears in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also included are cover image URLs in three sizes:  \n",
    "**Image-URL-S**, **Image-URL-M**, **Image-URL-L** (small, medium, large).  \n",
    "These URLs direct to Amazon's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratings Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains book rating information.  \n",
    "Ratings (**Book-Rating**) can be:\n",
    "- **explicit**, on a scale of 1–10 (higher value = better rating), or  \n",
    "- **implicit**, indicated by a value of 0 (user has not provided a numerical rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's objective is to build a book recommendation system that utilizes the Surprise library to implement a user-specific recommendation model. The system aims to predict what kinds of books an individual user is likely to appreciate, based on previous ratings and the behavior of other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preprocessing and Quality Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merging book and rating data\n",
    "- Removing invalid ISBN codes\n",
    "- Handling implicit entries (0-ratings)\n",
    "- Possible filtering of infrequent users and books\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Building a Recommendation Model with the Surprise Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training the model on user–book ratings\n",
    "- Experimenting with different algorithms (e.g., **SVD**, **KNNWithMeans**, **BaselineOnly**)\n",
    "- Evaluating model performance with cross-validation (MAE, RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generating Predictions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using an anti-test set to predict ratings for books the user has not yet read\n",
    "- Creating user-specific **Top-N recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Analysis and Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examining the model's accuracy and its limitations\n",
    "- Considering the impact of data structure on model performance\n",
    "- Presenting possibilities for further development (e.g., content-based enrichment, hybrid models)\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's end result is a functional prototype-level book recommendation system that can predict user preferences and provide them with personalized book suggestions based on user data."

    "## Analysis of SVD and KNN Model Results (Updated After Zero-Rating Removal and KNN Optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Model Performance with SVD\n",
    "- **RMSE:** 3.586  \n",
    "- **MAE:** 2.864  \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial error metrics were quite high, which is typical for heterogeneous and partially noisy book rating datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Results After Zero-Rating Removal (SVD)\n",
    "- **RMSE:** 1.585  \n",
    "- **MAE:** 1.218  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it improved:**  \n",
    "- Zero ratings acted as noise in the data.  \n",
    "- After removal, the model's predictions were based on more realistic user–book ratings, which significantly reduced the error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### KNN Model Results (Zero Ratings Removed and Hyperparameters Optimized)\n",
    "- **RMSE:** 0.852  \n",
    "- **MAE:** 0.557  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why KNN improved so much:**  \n",
    "1. **Pearson similarity**: accounts for users' different rating levels and removes systematic bias ratings.  \n",
    "2. **Optimization k=30**: more neighbors are included in the prediction → smoother and more accurate values.  \n",
    "3. **Item-based KNN** works well with dense data, such as here (~23 ratings per book).  \n",
    "4. CV hyperparameter selection enabled the model settings to best match the dataset structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Results improved dramatically: RMSE decreased by over 40% and MAE by over 50% compared to SVD results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Results\n",
    "- **Zero-rating removal** significantly improved the quality of both models.  \n",
    "- **KNN model now clearly the most accurate**, as the item-based method can leverage the dense data structure and similar books are easily found.  \n",
    "- **SVD model** still provides good predictions for generalization and works better with sparser datasets or top-N recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "- **SVD before:** RMSE/MAE ~3–3.6 → rough, mainly for ranking perspective.  \n",
    "- **SVD now:** RMSE/MAE ~1.2–1.6 → usable for rating predictions.  \n",
    "- **KNN now:** RMSE 0.852, MAE 0.557 → clearly the best accuracy based on this dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement Opportunities\n",
    "- SVD: Optimize the number of latent factors (**n_factors**).  \n",
    "- SVD: Fine-tune hyperparameters (**n_epochs**, **lr_all**, **reg_all**).  \n",
    "- KNN: Try different `k` values, similarity methods, and weighting (item-based vs. user-based).  \n",

    "1. **Pearson similarity** accounts for users' average rating levels → removes systematic bias.  \n",
    "2. **Right k**: k=30 is appropriate so that only relevant neighbor books are weighted, but not too many misleading neighbor books.  \n",

    "- **n_factors** determines how many such dimensions the model learns.  \n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "- **KNNBasic (item-based, Pearson, k=30)** → best performance: RMSE 0.852, MAE 0.557.  \n",
    "- **SVD** → useful for generalization, RMSE 1.584, MAE 1.216.  \n",
    "- Removed zero ratings and optimized hyperparameter selection explain the significant improvement in KNN results."
