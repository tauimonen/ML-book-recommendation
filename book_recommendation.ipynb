    "## Book Recommendation Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Books Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Books are identified by their ISBN codes.  \n",
    "Additionally, content-based information is included, such as **Book-Title**, **Book-Author**, **Year-Of-Publication**, and **Publisher**, which have been retrieved from Amazon Web Services.  \n",
    "If a book has multiple authors, only the first author appears in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also included are cover image URLs in three sizes:  \n",
    "**Image-URL-S**, **Image-URL-M**, **Image-URL-L** (small, medium, large).  \n",
    "These URLs direct to Amazon's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratings Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains book rating information.  \n",
    "Ratings (**Book-Rating**) can be:\n",
    "- **explicit**, on a scale of 1–10 (higher value = better rating), or  \n",
    "- **implicit**, indicated by a value of 0 (user has not provided a numerical rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's objective is to build a book recommendation system that utilizes the Surprise library to implement a user-specific recommendation model. The system aims to predict what kinds of books an individual user is likely to appreciate, based on previous ratings and the behavior of other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preprocessing and Quality Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merging book and rating data\n",
    "- Removing invalid ISBN codes\n",
    "- Handling implicit entries (0-ratings)\n",
    "- Possible filtering of infrequent users and books\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Building a Recommendation Model with the Surprise Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training the model on user–book ratings\n",
    "- Experimenting with different algorithms (e.g., **SVD**, **KNNWithMeans**, **BaselineOnly**)\n",
    "- Evaluating model performance with cross-validation (MAE, RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generating Predictions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using an anti-test set to predict ratings for books the user has not yet read\n",
    "- Creating user-specific **Top-N recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Analysis and Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examining the model's accuracy and its limitations\n",
    "- Considering the impact of data structure on model performance\n",
    "- Presenting possibilities for further development (e.g., content-based enrichment, hybrid models)\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's end result is a functional prototype-level book recommendation system that can predict user preferences and provide them with personalized book suggestions based on user data."
